# Project find_p
A collection of Notebooks with different analysis and optimization of Technical indicators for
Algorithmic trading.

**The Notebooks are set up to work with Google Colab**

Indicator:

* MACD (Optimization, Analysis):
  MACD is specially good in trending markets, but generate alot of noise in saideways markets.
* STOCH (Optimization, Analysis)
* RSI (Optimization, Analysis)

**Note:** The notebooks used for analysis will not include the optimized 
parameters, in case you want to use the optimized parameters you need 
to set them, I recommend to start with the default parameters
